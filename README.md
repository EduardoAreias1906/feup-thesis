## 📖 Project Overview
Connections Academy schools serve over 100,000 K-12 students across 32 U.S. states. Despite this scale, there is limited research on the fine-grained behavioral patterns of students in these fully online environments.

This dissertation investigates **"Virtual Choreographies"**—recurring sequences of learning actions—to understand how students navigate content, interact with teachers, and manage their time. The goal is to identify which behavioral patterns correlate with academic success and student engagement.

## 🎯 Objectives
1.  **Identification:** Discover recurring sequences of online learning actions (choreographies) in large-scale activity logs.
2.  **Characterization:** Analyze how these patterns vary across grades, subjects, and student profiles (e.g., at-risk students).
3.  **Association:** Correlate choreographies with academic outcomes (grades, retention, progression).

## 🛠 Methodology & Tech Stack
The project utilizes **Artificial Intelligence** and **Educational Data Mining** techniques:
* **Unsupervised Learning:** K-means clustering, t-SNE, and UMAP for pattern discovery and dimensionality reduction.
* **Supervised Learning:** Decision Trees, Random Forests, and lightweight Neural Networks for predictive modeling.
* **Framework:** "Virtual Choreographies" (INESC TEC).

## 📂 Repository Structure

* `src/`: *(In Development)* Python source code for data processing and AI models.
* `thesis/`: *(In Development)* Final dissertation document (LaTeX).
